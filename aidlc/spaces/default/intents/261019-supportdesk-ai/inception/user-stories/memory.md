## Interpretations
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — chose REST over GraphQL; the consuming team only needs CRUD, revisit if subscriptions land -->
- 2026-10-19T14:45:00Z — Settled two reviewer concerns from Requirements Analysis inside the stories without changing requirements: a malformed body or non-numeric id returns 400 (AC4.1.3), and PUT ignores status/AI fields (AC1.4.4).

## Deviations
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — skipped the optional caching layer the stage prose suggested; the dataset is small enough that it adds risk -->

## Tradeoffs
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — picked TDD over BDD this run; the team is unit-first and the domain is well-understood -->
- 2026-10-19T14:45:00Z — Deferred NFR6–NFR9 (performance, async, code structure, coverage) to later stages instead of inventing developer-facing stories, keeping every story tied to a persona's goal.

## Open questions
<!-- example: 2026-05-29T10:14:32Z — confirm the retention window with compliance before the next stage hardens the schema -->
